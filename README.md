AirBnB Clone - The Console
Description
This project is the first step towards building a full web application of the AirBnB clone.
<br /> In this first step we are building a console, a custom command interpreter that will be used in subsequent AirBnB projects to manage objects of our classes.

This console will allow us to do the following: <br />

Create a new object <br />
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc… <br />
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…) <br />
Update attributes of an object <br />
Destroy an object

Usage: <br />
The console can be run in both interactive and non-interactive mode.
It prints a prompt (hbnb) and waits for the user for input.
